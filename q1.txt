I wouldn't say I like submitting a job or project with a small mistake.
I usually complete my tasks as soon as possible.
The prospect of failing worries me.
My doubts have affected some of the most critical decisions in my life (what to study, where to look for a job, what car to buy, etc.).
I tend to put off getting things done, even if they are essential.
I often commit to more tasks than I can handle.
Whenever I'm faced with a deadline at work, I wait until the last minute.
I get frustrated in quick way when obstacles interfere with the pursuit of my goals.
When I have to face a family or couple problem, I never start a dialogue, I wait for the other person to make the first move, and even then, I tend to avoid it.
I find it challenging to get to work when I know I have many tasks to do.
