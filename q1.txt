I don't mind to submitting a job or project with a small mistake.
I usually complete my tasks as soon as possible.
The prospect of failing it doesn't worries me.
My doubts haven't affected some of the most critical decisions in my life (what to study, where to look for a job, what car to buy, etc.).
I don't tend to put off getting things done, even if they are essential.
I often commit to more tasks than I can handle.
Whenever I'm faced with a deadline at work, I don't wait until the last minute.
I don't get frustrated in quick way when obstacles interfere with the pursuit of my goals.
When I have to face a family or couple problem, I start a dialogue, and I don't wait for the other person to make the first move and I don't avoid it.
I don't find it challenging to get to work when I know I have many tasks to do.
At the beginning of each week, I already have a plan of what I have to do and when I will do it.
When I have to buy gifts, I do it well in advance, instead of leaving it for a few days beforehand.
When I get mad at someone, I prefer to explain them why I'm upset.
When I have to do a task that I don't like very much, I have to force myself to do it, or else I can't do it.
I generally pay my bills or money I owe someone on time.
When I see a message on my mobile from someone I know who wants to talk to me about their problems, I tend to calling them back as soon as I can.
I don't cancel or change plans with my friends or partner at the last minute.
When I am at work or studying, I am focused in the task I'm doing.
I know precisely how long it will take me to perform a specific task.
I wouldn't say I like facing complex challenges.
